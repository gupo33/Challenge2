A C++ library to handle sparse matrices. It allows to construct matrices of arbitrary size, accessing them, printing information about them, compressing, uncompressing, performing matrix-\/vector multiplication, and reading the matrix from a file encoded in the Matrix-\/\+Market format. The matrices can store any arbitrary data type, and can be ordered in row-\/major and column-\/major form. The matrices, when uncompressed, are store in COOmap form, and can be compressed in CSR / CSC form.
